IGNIVOX - Ready to upload static website
---------------------------------------

Files generated:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- /assets/ (placeholders for dashboard.jpg, serverroom.jpg, map.jpg)

IMPORTANT:
1. Replace the placeholder files in /assets/ with high-quality images (Unsplash or Pexels).
   Suggested image searches: "futuristic data lines", "abstract digital wave", "secure server room", "cloud computing background", "corporate tech office".
2. Replace the <video> sources in index.html with licensed short looping background videos if you have them.
3. Update CIN and GSTIN in the footer (currently placeholders).
4. To upload to Hostinger:
   - Zip the folder (ignivox-website.zip) and upload to public_html via hPanel File Manager or use FTP.
   - Ensure index.html is at the root of your domain folder (public_html).
5. If you want me to embed Google Maps, contact form backend, or generate a zip with actual image files downloaded, tell me and I will adjust.
